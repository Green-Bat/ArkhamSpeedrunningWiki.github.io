# Framerate

All console versions of Arkham Origins run at 30fps. The PC version is uncapped by default. If Vsync is disabled, it can be capped manually using [.ini file edits](https://arkhamspeedrunningwiki.github.io/page.html?page=Guides/Origins/FPS).

# Butterfly Gliding

Butterfly gliding is PC exclusive, as it can only be done with keyboard and mouse.

# Quickfire Multibatarangs

On PC, you can bind Quickfire Multibatarangs (Gadget 4) to a keyboard input. This is heavily used in combat and predator encounters.

# Mousewheel

On the PC version, the mousewheel can be bound to **_quickfire_** gadgets. This is done through the 'Controls' settings from within the game itself without any .ini file edits.

This a list of gadgets that can be quickfired using the mousewheel:
- Batarang (Gadget 1)
- Batclaw (Gadget 2)
- Explosive Gel (Gadget 3)
- Triple Batarang (Gadget 4)
- Glue Grenade (Gadget 5)
- Smoke Bomb (Gadget 6)
- Concussion Detonator (Gadget 11)

The mousewheel can also be bound to **_select_** a specific gadget.

# Animation Cancels

All animation cancels can be done on all versions, but are theoretically easier on console due to the lower framerate.
These include:
- Door cancels
- Ground takedown cancels
- Silent takedown cancels

# Bane Hideout Glide

Bane hideout glide is _extremely_ difficult to do on controller, if not outright impossible. Even if possible, it would not be of any benefit on console, as doing it will require at least one Butterfly Glide to be able to finish the run.
