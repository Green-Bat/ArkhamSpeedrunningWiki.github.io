For zips to work correctly, you need to run the game at 62fps, which is the default framerate without v-sync. If it's running at 60fps, you need to disable v-sync. Disable it in the game's launcher, and make sure it's not forced on by any third-party programs like Nvidia Control Panel.
You also want PhysX off, and DirectX 11 Features and Tessellation off. PhysX generally creates lag and makes the papers in the intro fight area move around, making it impossible to line up for the skip. I have no idea what DX11 does in the game, or how it affects the speedrun, but apparently it's best to have it off.
