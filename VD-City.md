**Note:** This page is a work in progress, and the various console versions have not been rigorously tested (and much of the testing that *was* done has not been documented). As a result, some of this information may not be entirely accurate.

# Framerate/Zips

All console versions of Arkham City are locked to 30fps (on current patch). The PS4 version was originally uncapped, but a 30fps cap was introduced in v1.02. The PC version is capped at 62fps by default (with Vsync disabled). Zips behave differently at different framerates, so there are some zips that only work on the PC version (and a few that only work on console/PC locked to 30fps).

The following zips only work on PC/62fps:
- Zip after leaving GCPD 1 (this *can* put you somewhere useful on console, but is extremely inconsistent)
- Dino Skip ([console variation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwtMPDewdw) known as 'Pterodactyl Skip')
- Zip after leaving the Museum (there's an undocumented variation of this)
- Modern Dead Parents Skip (there's a variation of this, but it may be slower. Old way works)
- Old version of Protocol 10 skip (modern version may not work for unrelated reasons)

There are currently no 30fps zips that are superior to the PC/62fps zips.

Animation cancels (specifically, Alternate Fire Cancels) are theoretically easier at 30fps.

# Mousewheel

On the PC version, the [mousewheel can be used](https://arkhamspeedrunningwiki.github.io/page.html?page=Guides/City/Mousewheel) to speed up certain actions and encounters. We currently bind Countering, Interact/Dive Rolls, and Skipping Dialogue to the mousewheel. This saves time in a couple parts of the game, most notably all skippable dialogue and the group-counter during the Ra's boss fight.

# Load Times
Load times vary significantly by platform. From best to worst:
- PC (assuming you have a decent one)
- Xbox 360
- Xbox ONE
- PS4

Not enough data exists to rank PS3 or WiiU load times.

**Note:** No formal testing has been done on this yet. The ordering here is based on approximations.

# Gliding

Gliding is *significantly* easier while using keyboard and mouse, and offers greater precision than is available with a controller. Though, all glides *can* be done on a controller.

# Ra's Cutscene Skip

The cutscene skip we do at the end of the Ra's boss fight can only be performed on keyboard and mouse (and therefore, only on the PC version). There is allegedly a way to make it happen on controller, but there is no detailed description or video evidence of this.

# Wonder Tower
Freeze grenade climbing is significantly easier on keyboard, since it involves mashing the '5' key instead of Right Trigger.

(unconfirmed) If you perform Protocol 10 skip on a console version other than Xbox 360, one of two things will happen:
* The tower will never load
* The game will crash when you enter the theatre (confirmed on Xbox ONE)

# Return to Arkham (Remaster)
- Very poor and somewhat inconsistent load times (especially on PS4)
- Does not run at a consistent framerate (specifically in the overworld)
- More textures remain visible when you are out of bounds, so navigating out of bounds is easier
- 

# WiiU

* Origins-like Shock Gloves make combat faster
* Menu-ing with the WiiU gamepad is theoretically faster
* Does not run at a consistent framerate (if it did it could potentially be the fastest console version)
